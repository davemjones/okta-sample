# OKTA Sample App
This app is a developer learning tool to discover the basics of implementing OKTA sign-in with a React application.

To get the application working, the following tasks need to be completed:
1. Register for an OKTA Developer account
1. On the OKTA Admin Console, create an app.  The issuer and clientId keys will be needed for the next step.
1. Create a `.env` file in the /app folder.  Refer to `sample.env.local` as a template for your new `.env` file.  Replace the clientId and issuer values with the values provided from the OKTA Admin Console.

## OKTA Setup
When setting up your OKTA dev account, ensure there is the appropriate URL parameter on both the "Sign-in redirect URI" and the "Initiate login URI".  Refer to `oktaConfig.js` for valid parameters.

### For example (main app)
Sign-in redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/okta/redirect?app=main
Initiate login URI: http://localhost:3000/okta/login?app=main
